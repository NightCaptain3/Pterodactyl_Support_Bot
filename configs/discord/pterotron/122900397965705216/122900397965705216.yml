           Suppose you are having trouble connecting to a Panel or Node on the same network as your device, or Panel and Wings can't reach each other on the same network. In that case, you may have to edit your `/etc/hosts` file to point the domain to the local IP, as some routers don't handle NAT Loopback correctly, if at all. On Windows, this file is at `C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts`
           
           ```
           192.168.1.24 panel.mydomain.com node1.mydomain.com
           192.168.1.25 node2.mydomain.com

      - command: proxy
        response:
          - |
            Pterodactyl has features to enable use of proxies, however we cannot provide support for proxies as it adds great complexity to the application set up.  Troubleshooting complex network setups involving tunnels and proxies is extremely difficult to do without access to that network.  Supporting complex network issues is outside the scope of this support.
      - command: cgroup
        response:
          - |
            Should you experience issues with Docker statistics, there are a few ways to fix this. **Updating Docker to 20.10.16+**, enabling OOM killer for the servers, or changing cgroup version to V2. This is an issue with a containerd dependency that is **fixed in Docker 20.10.16+.**
            
            You can type `sudo docker info | grep "Cgroup Version"` to check your active cgroup version.
            
            To change your Cgroup version open the file at `/etc/default/grub` and add `systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=1` to the CMDLINE_LINUX, without removing any existing parameters inside. Type =1 to enable cgroup V2 and =0 for V1.
            
            It should look similar to `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=1"`. It might contain other existing parameters, in which case, you should add the new one at the end, e.g `"swapaccount=1 systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=1"`
            
            After that, run `sudo update-grub` followed by `sudo reboot` to apply it and restart the machine.

        response:
          - |
             The resource usage is retrieved from Docker stats. Type `docker stats` and make sure that statistics are displayed correctly for all containers.
             
             Resource usage stuck at 0 can be caused by your kernel cgroups not functioning or wrong Docker version installed for example, by using package manager or performing system package upgrade. You would need `docker-ce` and not `docker.io, docker-engine, docker`. Docker versions below 20.10.16 do not work properly with cgroup V2.
             
             The correct Docker-ce version is installed at <https://pterodactyl.io/wings/1.0/installing.html#installing-docker>
             
             Restart the servers to rebuild containers once you've fixed your docker stats.

            Your connection to Wings will most likely fail when you are self-hosting Wings in the same network you are trying to connect from. This is because your router can't connect to itself over the public IP. There are several ways to fix this:

            **1.)** Enable NAT loopback/hairpinning in your router to force localhost connection
            **2.)** Modify your `/etc/hosts` file to point your Wings FQDN to localhost

            1.) The _Panel_ will run fine on a Windows machine. You'll need to figure out how to get it running, we do not offer any support.
            2.) Wings **will not** run on Windows.

            In all, we do not recommend trying to run any of this software on Windows, you'll be completely on your own.

            Your Panel is having some troubles connecting to your Wings instance. Chances are that Wings is offline or behind a firewall. You'll want to grab error logs from the Panel to help us resolve this issue. To do so, run the command below

            ```tail -n 150 /var/www/pterodactyl/storage/logs/laravel-$(date +%F).log | nc pteropaste.com 99```

            Please have a look at our list of common problems and solutions as well: <https://pterodactyl.io/panel/1.0/troubleshooting.html>

            Your database is refusing the Panel's attempts to connect to it. This can be for a number of different reasons so I'll let a human double check, but here are some ideas.

            1. Is your MySQL instance running? `systemctl status mysql`(hopefully not down the road) 
            2. Is the user you're trying to connect with authorized to access the given database from this IP address?
            3. Did you correctly give that user permission to even access that database?
            4. Do you have a Firewall that is blocking connections?
            5. Is your MySQL instance bound to `127.0.0.1` or `localhost` and you're trying to connect from outside the server?
            6. Does the user have `GRANT` permissions if you're trying to use them to create a new database for a server?
            7. Have special characters in your password? Make sure DB_PASSWORD in your .env file is enclosed in double quotes

            Let's clear some stuff up since it appears we're discussing running on Windows/WSL.

            1.) The _Panel_ will run fine on a Windows machine. You'll need to figure out how to get it running, we do not offer any support.
            2.) Wings **will not** run on Windows. Panel is useless without Wings.

            In all, we do not recommend trying to run any of this software on Windows, you'll be completely on your own. There is no support provided for Windows.

            Anyways, &user&, it looks like your DNS hasn't fully resolved so your Wings and Panel (or your browser) are having some trouble finding eachother. Saddest love story since Finding Nemo...

            You'll need to wait for your DNS to finish propagating, which you can confirm by running the following command on your computer, or whatever server is having issues connecting.

            ```
            dig your-panel.com NS

            Looks like you're not running PHP 7.4 or higher.

After that, find your Node configuration in the Panel, and copy the updated configuration to Wings.

When using other PHP versions, make sure to change the `php-fpm` version in your config to match your used PHP version.

            Hey &user&! Your database appears to be timing out or closing the connection. This error can happen for many reasons, such as using external IP while database has remote connections disabled, sending too large packets or a NAT reflection issue. For NAT I respond with more details when you type `.nat` into this chat.
            
            If you are not using external address for the connection, you can try to increase the values below in your `my.cnf` file by copying the example theoretical values shown below, adjust them if necessary.
          
            ```
            [mysqld]

            interactive_timeout=300
            ```          
            
            Type `find /etc -iname my.cnf` to find the location of the file. Restart your mysql `systemctl restart mysql` to apply the changes and pray it works.

             Broken docker stats can be caused by your Linux Kernel cgroups controllers not functioning or the wrong Docker version installed by using a package manager or performing a system package upgrade.
             
             Type `.cgroup` in this chat for me to provide more information about cgroup and containerd issues that a lot of Ubuntu users are experiencing after updating their system.

            Hey &user&! You appear to be using cgroup V2, which doesn't support OOM killer. You can ignore and not use it, or downgrade to cgroup V1.
            
            Downgrading can be done by adding `systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=0`to your grub cmdline at `/etc/default/grub`. After that, run `sudo update-grub` followed by `sudo reboot` to restart the machine.

        response:
          - |
            ARK requires RCON for console output. You have to wait for the server to start before it can connect to the RCON.
            
            Ensure that you have RCON enabled, enough memory allocated, and don't have any errors for missing files during the startup or a mistyped map name in the startup variables that would prevent it from starting.

            Admin panel -> Servers -> {Your Server} -> Build Configuration -> Allocation Management
            
            They must also be allowed in your external firewalls, such as one from your provider (OVH game firewall, GCP, AWS, etc).

            You also need to configure the database bind-address to listen on all interfaces following the guide below.

            &user& The Docker image or application that you are trying to use does not support your CPU architecture. Support for ARM64 is scarce, and most applications do not support it; thus, Docker images for those applications are built for AMD64(x86_64) only.
            
            Multiarch Docker images have been built for applications that do run on ARM64, so make sure that your egg and docker image is up to date. SteamCMD eggs will not work at all.

          - |
            ARK requires RCON for console output. You have to wait for the server to start before it can connect to the RCON.
            
            Ensure that you have RCON enabled, enough memory allocated (+8-14GB depending on map), and don't have any errors for missing files during the startup or a mistyped map name in the startup variables that would prevent it from starting. Be aware that ARK is a resource intensive game.
            
            Any issues with connecting to ARK server once it has started successfully are caused by a firewall or missing allocations. ARK requires multiple allocations with the **query port** used for joining. Type `.ports` if you don't know how to assign new allocations.

           The Pterodactyl panel does not currently contain any translation systems, except legacy leftovers for the Admin panel translation. Any translations would require modifying every single component and rebuilding the Panel.
           
           Panel update would overwrite all these changes, requiring them to be repeated - unless you manage a separate fork.
